# About

<p>
  Welcome to yet another random webpage in the cyberspace written by a random human on planet Earth. Random bits is a personal outlet 
  to talk about random bits of things that is going in my mind and life.
</p>

<p>I am a Math student, software developer, and a random human who writes random things. Being bored of work, I decided to pursue another degree which led me to my current study in Mathematics. I maintain a blog focusing on programming and hopefully math at <a href = "https://zakuarbor.github.io/blog">zakuarbor.github.io/blog</a>.
