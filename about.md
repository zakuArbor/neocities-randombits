# About

<p>
  Welcome to yet another random webpage in the cyberspace¹ written by a random human on planet Earth. Random bits is a personal outlet 
  to talk about random² bits of things that is going in my mind and life.
</p>

Random Bits is not a name I go by fyi. Any other sites and social media using this name is not me. Over the span of my digital life, I have 
gone through various names but these days I go by zakuarbor. [zakuarbor](https://github.com/zakuArbor/) is the name of my Github account and 
therefore also my [blog](https://zakuarbor.github.io/blog). Like many names in the digital world, this name was chosen arbitrary, within a 
few minutes before the creation of my account back in 2016. It stems from my favorite Grunt from the Universe of Gundam, the Zaku, and 
one of the symbols of my university, arbor, which is tree in English.

I am a Math student, software developer, and a random human who writes random things. 
Being bored of work, I decided to pursue another degree which led me to my current study in Mathematics. 
I maintain a blog focusing on programming and hopefully math at <a href = "https://zakuarbor.github.io/blog">zakuarbor.github.io/blog</a>.

* I know no one asked but yes I am obsessed with Pikachu. 
* Linux > Windows (this is the truth, don't deny it)
* Digimon Adventures > Pokémon (this is a fact)
* Perl > Python for text manipulation (stop this madness using Python for text analysis aside from machine learning)
* Vim is a great text editor
* I study Math and yes I unfortunately learned too late that studying Math is not a pleasant way to kill time
