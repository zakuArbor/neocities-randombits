# About

Welcome to yet another random webpage in the cyberspace¹ written by a random human on planet Earth. Random bits is a personal outlet 
to talk about random² bits of things that is going in my mind and life.

Random Bits is not a name I go by fyi. Any other sites and social media using this name is not me. Over the span of my digital life, I have 
gone through various names but these days I go by zakuarbor. [zakuarbor](https://github.com/zakuArbor/) is the name of my Github account and 
therefore also my [blog](https://zakuarbor.github.io/blog). Like many names in the digital world, this name was chosen arbitrary, within a 
few minutes before the creation of my account back in 2016. It stems from my favorite Grunt from the Universe of Gundam, the Zaku, and 
one of the symbols of my university, arbor, which is tree in English.

I am a Math student, software developer, and a random human who writes random things. 
Being bored of work, I decided to pursue another degree which led me to my current study in Mathematics. 
I maintain a blog focusing on programming and hopefully math at <a href = "https://zakuarbor.github.io/blog">zakuarbor.github.io/blog</a>.

* I know no one asked but yes I am obsessed with Pikachu. 
* Linux > Windows (this is the truth, don't deny it)
* Digimon Adventures > Pokémon (this is a fact)
* Perl > Python for text manipulation (stop this madness using Python for text analysis aside from machine learning)
* Vim is a great text editor
* I study Math and yes I unfortunately learned too late that studying Math is not a pleasant way to kill time

<b>Short FAQs</b>
1. Who am I?

    I am a random human on the internet that is bored.

2. Are you American?

    No. I live more North where [2 out of 3](https://www.international.gc.ca/country-pays/us-eu/relations.aspx?lang=eng) live within 100km of the US borders because our country is apparently too cold.

3. How old am I?

    Older than I want to be is all I will say.

    Randomly cruising through life going between school and working at tech companies. I have been in school for a long time ...

5. What do I do in my free time?

    Being a degenerate and not be productive. I really should start excercising before my body gets too old and break into little pieces ...
    I mainly am addicted to wasting time for the sake of wasting time. This can range from reading manga, watching youtube, browsing Reddit, 
    and babbling on the internet such as Discord instead of doing what I really need or should be doing #procrastination

    Unfortunately, I only know English. I am still trying to work on my French and maybe I'll go back to my mother tongue after I become 
fluent in French.

7. What do I study?

    I have studied Computer Science years ago and decided to go back to school for Math which in hindsight may not have been the best use of my 
time ...

<b>FAQ? (*that no one ever asks me*)</b>
1. What is my earliest internet experience

    Being a kid who grew up in the 2000s, I only got small glimpses of the early internet but I did not get into computers till around 2010. 
This means I missed out on a lot of the old internet activities Geocities, Netscape, Limewire, Napster, AOL and IRC. My earliest experience 
with the internet is likely in grade school when we were being introduced to Wikipedia and how to search for articles through Google by 
manually typing *http://www.google.com* (and yes we had to type `http://www` to visit websites, at least from my memory). 
It was so revolutionary when you can just type your search onto your web browser and it'll direct you to 
the results on google (At the time of writing, the US courts ruled [Google has illegal monopoly over online searches](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/google-illegal-monopoly-1.7285798)). 
I recall on Internet Explorer, it was popular to install the Google Toolbar which was surprisingly still alive [till recently in 2021](https://hackaday.com/2021/12/16/gone-google-toolbar-2000-2021/).

    The earliest games I am played online was probably Neopets, Miniclip, and Maplestory (which went downhill after Big Bang event imo). I grew 
up with Flash games and Java applets which were annoying to update once in a while to use. I think Megaupload didn't require you to have the 
latest Java versions which was great to watch anime till it got shutdown. I still remember when Google Video was a thing before it got killed 
and replaced with Youtube.

2. What Web Browser do I use?

    I mainly use Firefox which I have been a fan of since I got into in Highschool. However, I have been using Brave, a privacy focused chromium 
browser, to watch anime and attend remote classes on Zoom. For unknown reasons, Firefox on my Linux machine cannot seem to buffer videos from the anime sources I use. 
I used to be a user of Firefox Aurora, a "nightly" build of Firefox, and Firefox Web Developer Edition.

3. What Operating System do I use?

    I have been using Fedora Linux since 2021 after I have been daily driving RedHat for a year at work and came to like the OS and wanted to 
use something similar but more "bleeding edge". Prior to using RedHat, I have been a committed Ubuntu user from 2016 - 2020 after my Windows 
8 laptop died on hours before the deadline for my Physics lab which corrupted my report. Getting fed up with Windows being slow on my machine 
and eventually getting a 0 after losing all my work, I finally made the jump. Prior to the jump, I only tried various Linux distros for a few days 
and then switch to another distro for fun and fiddling with using Raspbian to host a local web server.

    I have used various versions of Windows such as 95, XP, Vista (which I didn't know was bad but it looked so cool and modern at the time), 
7, 10, and unfortunately 11 due to work ... I do not understand the rational behind using Windows when all our work is to be done on a Linux 
virtual machine or server. The smartest decision Windows ever made was to introduce WSL to Windows (though WSL 1 was a bit of a pain from 
my very limited first impresison but WSL2 was a pleasant experience).

4. What Game Consoles did I grew up and what consoles do I use these days

    I grew up with the Gameboy Color, Advance and Advanced SP which were had very great games imo. I mainly played Pokémon Yellow and Silver though. 
I also grew up with the DS but I prefered my Advanced SP since it could play my beloved Pokémon GBC games. I played a lot of Chocobo Racing on the 
Playstation 1 and a bit of Tekken on Playstation 2. I did own a Wii and PS4 but I much preferred Playstation 1 and 2 over them. 
Growing up, I got to play SNES and N64 but never got the opportunity to play the Sega Saturn nor the Dreamcast. No one around me ever owned them.

    These days, I don't play much video games. I have a used Switch Lite I bought off from my sister as she wanted cash to buy an actual 
Switch. But it's mainly sitting there collecting dust. As for PC games, my first actual PC game was Starcraft when I was visiting my Dad in Korea, 
which was very popular at the time. I played random pirated games in LAN parties with friends such as Age of Empires and Age of Mythologies but again,
I was not a very big gamer.
