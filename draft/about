<h1>About</h1>
<p>
I'm a random human who missed out much of the early internet including Geocities. Growing up with Flash and Java Applets in the early 2000s, I do not miss them at all. Long gone are the days of updating flash and Java to access games and watch movies (looking at you Veoh). However, there are aspects of the internet of my childhood I miss as I find myself going only to a extremely small set of sites on a daily basis. The internet seems to be centralizing with the same aesthetics.

<p>I am a Math student, software developer, and a random human who writes random things. Being bored of work, I decided to pursue another degree which led me to my current study in Mathematics. I maintain a blog focusing on programming and hopefully math at <a href = "https://zakuarbor.github.io/blog">zakuarbor.github.io/blog</a>. 
</p>

<p>
If you are wondering what is the point of the site, I have no clue. The plan is to repost some blogs and use neocity as a more 
personal outlet to talk about random things that is going on in my mind and life.
