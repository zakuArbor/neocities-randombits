I recently learned that websites can be terminated with a `.` such as [`www.google.com.`](www.google.com.) or [`https://neocities.org.`](https://neocities.org.). 
However, this does not work [for all websites](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/09/12/why-do-domain-names-end-with-a-dot-/). I was skimming through *Network for Dummies* 
during work and while it doesn't cover anything useful for the work I am trying to do (if you have taken a network course before, don't bother reading this book unless 
you were bored like I was<sup>1</sup>), terminating a website with a `.` was a surprise. 

The book states that `If a domain name ends with a trailing dot, ..., and the domain name is said to be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN)`.
The difference between an absolute name (FQDN) and relative name is important when working with DNS and can cause an "internet outage" if 
done incorrectly as [one user on hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32862913) comments. Based on some [article](http://www.dns-sd.org/trailingdotsindomainnames.html) 
([linked by a stackoverflow user](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36931853/if-there-exists-a-dot-after-com-is-it-a-valid-url)), websites that fail 
to handle `.` in their domain names are the ones who are in violation of [RFC 1738](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt) or at least not heeding 
to its recommendations.


**Notes:**

<sup>1</sup> While Network for Dummies was actually fun to read surprisingly due to the author's writing style, it lacks technical depth which should come to no surprise.
