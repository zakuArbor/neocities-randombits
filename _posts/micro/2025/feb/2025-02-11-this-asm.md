I was recently reminded that the variable `this` is an implicit parameter passed to all methods in OOP such as C++. We can observe this by comparing a regular function vs a method 
belonging to some class:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void greet() {
    std::cout << "Hello World\n";
}

class Human {
public:
    void greet() {
        std::cout << "Hello World\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    greet();
    Human human = Human();
    human.greet();
}
```

**Output:**
```
$ g++ test.C
$ ./a.out 
Hello World
Hello World
```

Both may output the same thing but under the hood is where the differences shines. Note: I'll be only showing the code of interest.

For `greet`:
```nasm
Dump of assembler code for function _Z5greetv:
   0x0000000000401126 <+0>:	push   %rbp
   0x0000000000401127 <+1>:	mov    %rsp,%rbp
   0x000000000040112a <+4>:	mov    $0x402280,%esi
```

For `Human::greet`:
```nasm
Dump of assembler code for function _ZN5Human5greetEv:
   0x000000000040115c <+0>:     push   %rbp
   0x000000000040115d <+1>:     mov    %rsp,%rbp
   0x0000000000401160 <+4>:     sub    $0x10,%rsp
   0x0000000000401164 <+8>:     mov    %rdi,-0x8(%rbp)
   0x0000000000401168 <+12>:	mov    $0x402280,%esi
```

For `greet` (`_Z5greetv`), we can immediately tell that the function takes in no arguments both by the mangled name (i.e. mangled name ends with `v` to indicate its parameter is `void`) 
and from the disassembled code. However, the same cannot be said for `Human::greet`. The mangled name `_ZN5Human5greetEv` does suggest that the method does not take in any parameter 
and hence the suffix `v` for `void`. But observe the following line in `<+8>`:
```nasm
mov    %rdi,-0x8(%rbp)
```

`This` is our implicit argument, `this`, which contains the address of the object itself. We can observe this via gdb:
```
(gdb) p &human
$2 = (Human *) 0x7fffffffdc4f
...
(gdb) i r rdi
rdi            0x7fffffffdc4f      140737488346191
```

Notice our `rdi` register contains the same address as our object `human`: `0x7fffffffdc4f`. 

<!--
We can also replicate this in `arm` where `w0` or `x0` will be set with the address of 
our object `human`:
```nasm
(gdb) disassemble /s Human::greet
...
<+32>:	add	x0, sp, #0x10
<+36>:	bl	0x100c1170 <_ZN5Human5greetEv>
...
(gdb) p &human
$1 = (Human *) 0x81c60
...

x0             0x81c60             531552
10	        std::cout << "Hello World\n";
=> 0x00000000100c117c <+12>:	adrp	x0, 0x100c1000 <__do_global_dtors_aux+64>
```

**Note:** ARM is running QNX because I was too lazy to reimage my Raspberry Pi for this demo
