I recently found out accidentally at work that `vim` and `view` were the same thing when I happened to be editing a file on `view` instead of my beloved `vim` editor.
This should not come to any surprise, plenty of documentation will state this such as the man pages:

```
$ man -Leng view
VIM(1)                                                                  General Commands Manual                                                                  VIM(1)

NAME
       vim - Vi IMproved, a programmer's text editor

SYNOPSIS
       vim [options] [file ..]
       vim [options] -
       vim [options] -t tag
       vim [options] -q [errorfile]

       ex gex
       view
       gvim gview vimx evim eview
       rvim rview rgvim rgview
```

Interestingly, the man pages for `view` points to `vim` and we can see all sorts of different types of editors listed along with it such as `gvim`.
If we take a look at [AIX 7.3 documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=v-view-command):
```
Starts the vi editor in read-only mode.
```

Taking a look at my local system (Fedora 41), we indeed see that is the case:
```
#!/usr/bin/sh

# run vim -R if available
if test -f /usr/bin/vim
then
  exec /usr/bin/vim -R "$@"
fi

# run vi otherwise
exec /usr/libexec/vi -R "$@"
```

However, here's where things gets weird. At work, `view` was a pointer to `vi`:
```
$ realpath view
/usr/bin/vi
```

However, on my other development machine, `view` was simply another binary that had the same md5sum. This has made me theorized that `vi` checks its name to 
see whether or not to open the file in read-only mode based if it started with the name `view`. So I made an experiment by creating a new "binary" called `view-pika` (by creating a link to `vim`).
The result was as I theorized: **it opened the file as READ-ONLY**. I'll go a deeper dive on my [blog](https://zakuarbor.github.io/blog/) sometime this week 
to understand why (spoiler, it's essentially what I theorized).
