Framework is a company that makes modular and repairable laptops that has captured the interests of tech enthusiasts over the past 4 years. 
Currently Framework laptops are limited to x86-64 architecture supporting Intel and later AMD CPUs in 2023. Although Framework laptops are not 
entirely open source, they have <a href = "https://github.com/FrameworkComputer">open source a decent chunk of their work</a> from my understanding and 
which allows third party development of components and makes partnership possible for other companies such as 
<a href = "https://frame.work/ca/en/blog/introducing-a-new-risc-v-mainboard-from-deepcomputing" alt = "Framework announcement of introducing a RISC-V mainboard">
DeepComputing to release a mainboard that runs a RISC-V CPU
</a>. While the new mainboard will not be usable for everyday applications, it is a step forward to a more open ecosystem and this is an exciting step for both 
Framework, RISC-V and the broader open-advocate community. This announcement makes me wonder the possibility of OpenPower running on a Framework laptop. 
Similarly to RISC-V, there isn't an easily accessible way to obtain a consumer product running on OpenPower (aside from Raptor Computing with their 
extremely expensive machines). There is the 
<a href = "https://www.powerpc-notebook.org/en/" alt = "PowerPC NoteBook Community Page">
PowerPC Notebook project
</a> ran by a group of volunteers who are trying to develop an open source PowerPC notebook to the hands of hobbyists. It would be interesting 
if OpenPower community could also partner with Framework to develop a mainboard once the project is complete and the software is more matured. 
However, this would be a difficult step as there is no dedicated company like DeepComputing that will pour resources into making this happen. 
The interest into OpenPower is low and overshadowed by the wider industry interest in expanding the ARM and RISC-V architecture to consumers. 
IBM made a huge mistake in open sourcing the POWER architecture too late. But one could always dream (even if it's delusional) :D

<b>Website</b><br/>
In the past year I have been very lazy as evident with my <a href = "https://zakuarbor.github.io/blog/" alt = "Personal Blog">lacl of activity on my personal blog</a>.
I'm now trying to pick up blogging again. It's hard to believe that it's been almost an entire year since I created this neocity site, which has almost 0 updates since. 
I've been thinking about how to use this site since I already have a blog on GitHub Pages. Honestly, I forgot this corner existed, and it’s been bothering me that I couldn’t write my random, nonsensical thoughts because my main blog wouldn’t be a suitable medium until now.
So, I’ve decided that this corner will be a microblog where I can share random articles and thoughts. A microblog is different from a regular blog in that the content is much shorter. This space will allow me to quickly jot down something random. I hope that a collection of these random posts will evolve into a blog post or spark an idea for my final year thesis or project.

<b>How are my studies going?</b><br/>
I’m still studying Mathematics, but I’ve lost much of my initial interest in the field after taking a few third-year courses. I ended up taking fewer Math courses, which puts my ability to graduate on time at risk. Listening to lectures and reading about abstract groups and rings made me really miss programming and computer science. Despite this, there were still some Math courses I enjoyed, such as Combinatorics and Real Analysis. However, I didn’t last long in the follow-up Real Analysis courses that covered Stone-Weierstrass and Commutative C* Algebra. Feeling tired of abstract Mathematics, I decided to take a break and pursue an internship at a telecommunications enterprise.

<p/>

<b>What am I doing Now?</b><br/>
As mentioned, I am currently doing a year-long internship with a telecommunications enterprise. Although the job isn't very exciting, it's a welcome break from Mathematics. This would typically be a great chance to catch up on my Computer Science studies by delving into textbooks and online resources, but I’ve been quite lazy. Instead, I've been focusing on learning French, a language I've always wanted to master. I started learning French in elementary school, as it’s a requirement in Canada. While it might make more sense to learn my native tongue, I’m opting to learn French, which might seem confusing to some. For context, I don't have an English name and was born in a small Asian country. My parents have limited English skills, yet I still struggle to communicate in my native language for reasons I won't go into now.
